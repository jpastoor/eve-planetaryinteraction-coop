# EVE Planetary Interaction Coop
This application allows the sharing of planetery interaction goods without using the market. Instead
players use an Audit Log Container to take and return the goods. The application parses the log
and calculates the value that the players have contributed to the container.

### Current Status
Graphical UI non-existent, but the general idea's are present in the backend. It is possible
to parse transactions and calculate inventory and ledgers.

### Contribute
Any help is appreciated; see the current issue list in Github for an overview of things that need to happen.
In-line code TODO's are often a good starting point as well.

Not a coder yourself but want to support the project? Donations in ISK to Gebbetje are very much appreciated.
